<h1>The Apocalypse is coming</h1>
<p>Today three people saw zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh my goodness! There were so many. They were like drooling at the window and making brainzzzz sounds!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was just in my back garden then six zombies came from the woods behind my house! It was horrific!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I was looking out from my apartmentâ€™s balcony when I saw a pack of twenty zombies drooling as they walked along the street. It was terrifying because one of them looked at me!</p>
